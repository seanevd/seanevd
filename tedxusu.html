		<p>The <a href="http://rgs.usu.edu/tedxusu/">TEDxUSU</a> redesign was pretty difficult due to the lack of flexibility and freedom I was given. When I worked for USU I was given the task of redesigning the current site while not given access to change any HTML or ColdFusion files (USU's CMS was built in-house and is about 6 years out-of-date). They gave me a blank CSS file and linked it to the site and told me I could do whatever I wanted.</p>
		<p>It is a pretty difficult thing to come up with unique webpage with only changing the CSS, but I guess that is the whole premise behind <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/"></a>CSS Zen Garden</a>. Many of the changes the team wanted to make, simply weren't possible with the constraints I was given. Not only was I highly constricted by the school, but I was also given several rules for what can or cannot appear on a TEDx site from the TED organization. It was interesting to research what other people have done with their TEDx websites while coming up with my own design. However, I feel like the site turned out pretty good in the end (I cannot be held responsible for any content changes they did to the site after I gave the theme back to the good people at RGS).</p>
