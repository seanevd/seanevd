		<p><a href="http://katelynduncanphotography.com">Katelyn Duncan Photography</a> was my first major effort to create an entire WordPress theme from scratch. It was the first site I have made that was actually hosted on a server with a usable URL (I know the URL is impossibly long). My wife has a love for photography and wanted a place to post some of her photos, so I made an easy way for her to post them.</p>
		<p>I used Bootstrap for my frameworking on this site because I struggled learning how CMS's work while building a brand new theme from scratch. Initially, I had a lot of issues getting all the right things hooked up, but managed to find my way by learing from some great online tutorials and YouTube videos. This site is still one of my favorites even after a year of developing and designing others.</p>
