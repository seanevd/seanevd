  Welcome to John Doe Photography! Please, check out my <a href="/portfolio/">Portfolio</a> to see my work.

		<p>You're in! Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. Go ahead and edit this post to get going and learn how it all works!</p>

		<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

		<p>Writing in markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>formatting</em> shortcuts to style your content. For example, a list:</p>

		<ul>
		<li>Item number one</li>
		<li>Item number two
		<ul><li>A nested item</li></ul></li>
		<li>A final item</li>
		</ul>

		<p>or with numbers!</p>

		<ol>
		<li>Remember to buy some milk  </li>
		<li>Drink the milk  </li>
		<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>
		</ol>

		<h3 id="links">Links</h3>

		<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like <a href='http://ghost.org'>http://ghost.org</a> - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to <a href="http://ghost.org">the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>

		<h3 id="whataboutimages">What about Images?</h3>

		<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>

		<p><img src="http://tryghost.org/ghost.png" alt="The Ghost Logo" /></p>

		<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>

		<h3 id="quoting">Quoting</h3>

		<p>Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.</p>

		<blockquote>
		  <p>Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<h3 id="workingwithcode">Working with Code</h3>

		<p>Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>

		<pre><code>.awesome-thing {
		    display: block;
		    width: 100%;
		}
		</code></pre>

		<h3 id="readyforabreak">Ready for a Break?</h3>

		<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>

		<hr />

		<h3 id="advancedusage">Advanced Usage</h3>

		<p>There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can  write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.</p>

		<p><input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!" /></p>

		<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)</p>
