		<p><a href="http://blog.seanevd.com">Blog.seanevd</a> was initially an effort to experiment with the new blogging platform <a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a>. Soon after experimenting with Ghost, I found out that I needed to make some blog posts for a class I was in; so I decided to make Ghost my blogging platform. Publishing the Ghost CMS to production wasn't easy. I undertook the process back when it was at 0.3, so I was basically on my own for server setup. This was my first time experimenting with node.js and an Amazon EC2 instance. I was also fairly new to Handlebars, it was fun to learn more about this Node library coming from a PHP background. There was a lot of backend effort but it didn't take long to make the site live.</p>
		<p>I spent some time customizing the theme and used Sass for faster production. The site finally went live sometime in mid-October 2013. I later installed Disqus on my posts so people could comment about my tutorials. I have since been trying to work on some more quality posts to help organize my thoughts and spread the knowledge I have gained from various projects to others in the web development community.</p>
