		<p>The <a href="http://rgs.usu.edu/ascend/htm/ascend-december-2013/">RGS Ascend Newsletter</a> was the first HTML email I ever did. I have since made more HTML emails (I now know the tricks of responsive HTML emails) but this was one of my favorite projects and was probably recieved with the most praise of any project I have done. I was given the assignment to redesign the Ascend Newsletter when I worked at USU, because we had recently come up with a new rebranding strategy. I worked closely with our graphic designer to come up with a theme for the email.</p>
		<p>It is a strange thing going from modern HTML5 code and standards and then trying to make an HTML email. It requires a pretty big change in the way you problem solve for layout. I wasn't used to developing with tables, it is always a bit of a struggle going back to that old way of making websites. In the end, the whole team was very excited for the new look and I felt happy that I was able to fulfill the goals of the organization.</p>
