		<p>Variegated Design started as a class assignment for an intro to web development class. However, I already familiar with HTML and CSS at that point and took the site quite a bit further than the class requirements. I wanted to start a small web design firm in hopes that it would take off and provide me another form of income. I took this class assignment as an opportunity to get two birds with one stone.</p>
		<p>I made this site in April of 2013 and it was the first project I used Sass on. I have been using the preprocessor as my language of choice ever since. I also started messing around with the Skrollr.js library because of its ease of use with browser scroll position. I used it to apply opacity to the display font at the top of the page as the user scrolls and adds a drop shadow to logo and a fixed navigation comes out from underneath it.</p>
		<p>I only had a few minor difficulties with this site, including figuring out how to get the nav to fix to the top of the screen when the browser reaches a certain scroll point without making the rest of the page jump up a little after the element becomes fixed. Also, getting Sass working correctly and figuring out new syntax took a little bit of learning.</p>
		<p>This project was fairly enjoyable even though I may have never really used it to start a web design firm. I managed to always have a project to work on since then until now.</p>
