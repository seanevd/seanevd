		<p><a href="dwdesign/index.html">DW Design</a> was another class project that I made that never got hosted. I made this website in collaboration with another student and was created over GitHub. I had used GitHub before, but this project was the first time I had been immersed in a real world project whith complete code collaboration and version control on GitHub. This was the first time I had to deal with code conflict when we were working on the same stuff at the same time. Besides Git, we used the skrollr.js library along with a new css framework called lemonade.css. Cade, my classmate, implemented some javascript keystroke shortcuts for the form.</p>
		<p>This project taught me a lot about code collaboration. I also learned some of the pros and cons with working on a project along side another person. It can really stretch you and bring out some creativity that you probably wouldn't have tapped into had there not been another person pushing you in a different direction than you thought you would go.</p>
