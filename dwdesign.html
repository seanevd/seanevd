		<p><a href="dwdesign/index.html">DW Design</a> was a project I made for a class that didn't get hosted. I made this website in collaboration with another student, working in GitHub. I had used GitHub before, but this project was the first time I had been immersed in a real world project with complete code collaboration and version control on GitHub. This was the first time I had to deal with code conflict when we were working on the same stuff at the same time. Besides Git, we used the skrollr.js library along with a new css framework called lemonade.css. Cade, my classmate, implemented some javascript keystroke shortcuts for the form.</p>
		<p>This project taught me a lot about code collaboration. I also learned some of the pros and cons of working on a project along side another person. It can really stretch you and bring out some creativity that you probably wouldn't have tapped into had there not been someone pushing you in a different direction than you thought you would go.</p>
