		<p><a href="dwdesign/index.html">DW Design</a> was another class project that I made that never got hosted. I made this website in collaboration with another student and was created over GitHub. I had used GitHub before, but this project was the first time I had been immersed in a real world project whith complete code collaboration and version control on GitHub. This was the first time I had to deal with code conflict when we were working on the same stuff at the same time. </p>
