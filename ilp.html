		<p><a href="http://www.ilp.org/">ILP</a> is a non-profit organization that came to a student organization at my school and asked for some help in making a new WordPress theme. The organization, called Aggie Design Studios, came to me and asked for my help because of my background with WordPress. It was an interesting experience working with a project manager who knew fairly little about web development nor teh amount of time and effort required to make a project.</p>
		<p>The whole project was a fairly good learning experience. It was originally planned to take one month to complete but managed to stretch out over 6 months. The frustration levels for the project often peaked when things were not going well. Every week the client came back with additional requirements for the project and my project lead just told them we would take care of it.</p>
		<p>In the end I learned a lot about developing for a client who doesn't exactly know what they want as well as when to draw the line. It can be a fine line in keeping the client happy as well as staying within the agreed upon contract. It has still been a few months since the client has received the completed theme, yet as I write this, they still haven't implemented it on their site.</p>
